## Why I share them?
When I was going through what you're going through right now, I was able to survive that difficult time because of the sharing of my seniors. I want to pass on this spirit, and I hope you can do it one day, to be a better person, to be a better BJUTer.  
余尝历汝今之所遭，能度昔之艰时，乃前辈之援也。吾欲继之，望汝亦能如是，为更佳之人，更佳之工大人。
