On your own computer, just install anywhere convenient, and create a short-cut 
to point at it. Note that winmips64 will write two initialisation files into 
this directory, one winmips64.ini which stores architectural details, one 
winmips64.las which remembers the last .s file accessed.

On a network drive, install winmips64.exe into a suitable system directory. 
Then use a standard text editor to create a file called winmips64.pth, and put 
this file in the same directory.

The read-only file winmips64.pth should contain a single line path to a 
read-write directory private to any logged-in user. This directory will then 
be used to store their .ini and .las files.

For example winmips64.pth might contain

H:

or

c:\temp

But remember only a single line - don't press return at the end of it
